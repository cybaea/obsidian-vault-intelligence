Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 9.39.1

A configuration object specifies rule "obsidianmd/ui/sentence-case", but could not find plugin "obsidianmd".

Common causes of this problem include:

1. The "obsidianmd" plugin is not defined in your configuration file.
2. The "obsidianmd" plugin is not defined within the same configuration object in which the "obsidianmd/ui/sentence-case" rule is applied.
