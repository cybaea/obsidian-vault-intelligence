The cause was not one faulty algorithm. It was the unintended, destructive interaction between a <em>new</em> trading system and a piece of <em>old</em>, supposedly defunct code. The components, safe in isolation, created a devastating feedback loop when combined. As the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) later confirmed, this was a failure of systems interacting in an unforeseen way, running &quot;without any substantial human intervention&quot;</p></blockquote><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="Prompt: &quot;What do I know about a company that went bust because of software?&quot; showing results for Knight Capital, UK Post Office, and others"></p><h2 id="knowledge-verification" tabindex="-1">Knowledge verification <a class="header-anchor" href="#knowledge-verification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Knowledge verification&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Scenario</strong>: I am implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and want to check if my understanding is up to date.</p><p><em><strong>Query</strong>: &quot;What do I know about RAG and is my information comprehensive, factually correct, and up to date?&quot;</em></p><p><a href="https://github.com/cybaea/obsidian-vault-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vault Intelligence</a> not only retrieved my notes on RAG but also cross-verified the facts against a live Google Search.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt="Prompt: &quot;What do I know about RAG and is my information comprehensive, factually correct, and up to date?&quot; showing retrieval and verification results"></p><p>This is useful, even if the agent sounds like an over-excited puppy altogether too happy to please.
