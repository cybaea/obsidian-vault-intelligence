**Markdown formatting** rules:

- British English language with Oxford dictionary rules (language code `en-GB-oxendict`).
- GitHub Markdown format.
- No emoji anywhere.
- Use bold text sparingly.
    - For example there is no need to bold definitions in lists.
- Do not use bold (`**bold**`) in headings.
    - If you **must** emphasize something in a header, use italics (`_italics_`).
- Prefer sentence case in headings.
- Keep a blank line after headers as in the blank line after `## Subsection` in the example here:
    ```markdown
    Some text from the previous section.

    ## Subsection

    This is the first line of this subsection.
    ```
