# Vault Hygiene Philosophy

Why do vaults decay, and how does the Gardener fix it?

## The Problem: Entropy

As a vault grows, it naturally tends toward chaos (entropy).
-   We forget to add tags.
-   We create duplicate concepts under different names (e.g., `[[AI]]` vs `[[Artificial Intelligence]]`).
-   We lose the "latent" connections between ideas.

This "Vault Decay" makes your knowledge harder to retrieve and reduces the value of your second brain over time.

## Proactive vs Reactive Maintenance

Most users strictly do **Reactive Maintenance**: they fix a link only when they notice it is broken.

The **Gardener** inserts a layer of **Proactive Maintenance**.
1.  **Plan**: It scans the vault and creates a `Gardener Plan`.
2.  **Review**: You (the human) review the plan.
3.  **Apply**: The approved structural changes are applied in bulk.

## The Ontology Plan

The Gardener does not guess; it follows your **Ontology**. It looks at where you have stored previous concepts to determine where new ones belong.

-   If you put all companies in `Entities/Companies`, it will suggest moving new company notes there.
-   If you tag people with `#person`, it will suggest that tag for new contacts.

This creates a positive feedback loop: the improved structure makes future suggestions more accurate.
