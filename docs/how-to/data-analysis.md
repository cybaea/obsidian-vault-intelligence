# Solver: Analyse data with Python

Vault Intelligence includes a Computational Solver—an embedded Python environment that can execute code to analyse your notes.

## Prerequisites

1.  Enable Computational Solver in Settings.

2.  Ensure you have a valid Google API Key (required for code generation).

## Working with Tables

The most common use case is analysing Markdown tables in your notes.

_Scenario:_ You have a note `@Expenses` with a markdown table of transactions.

_Prompt:_
> "Read the table in @Expenses. Group the data by 'Category' and calculate the total sum for each. Plot the result as a pie chart."

## Forecasting and Trends

The agent can use Python libraries like `pandas` and `scikit-learn` to find patterns.

_Prompt:_
> "Extract the daily weight logs from @Health Journal. Calculate the 7-day moving average and forecast the trend for the next 14 days."

## Math and Logic

Standard LLMs are bad at math. The Solver is perfect for it.

_Prompt:_
> "Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 at 5% over 20 years, contributing $500 monthly."

## Privacy Note

The Python code runs in the cloud (via Google's secure sandbox) to ensure safety and isolation. Your note data is sent to the sandbox for processing but is not trained upon.
