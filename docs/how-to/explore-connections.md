# Explorer: Find connections

The Explorer view helps you rediscover forgotten notes and find hidden relationships between ideas as you write.

## Opening the Explorer

1.  Click the compass icon in the left ribbon to open the Explorer sidebar.
2.  Alternatively, use the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and search for: `Explorer: open similar notes view`.

## Finding Similar Notes

The Explorer works automatically based on your current active note.

-   Automatic Updates: As you switch between notes, the Explorer list refreshes to show the most semantically similar content in your vault.
-   Semantic Matching: Unlike standard search, the Explorer finds notes that share the same meaning, even if they use different keywords.
-   Relevance Scores: Each suggestion includes a similarity percentage. High scores (e.g., 85%+) indicate very close conceptual matches.

## Use Cases

### Finding the missing link

If you are writing about a new topic and feel like you've mentioned it before, check the Explorer. It might surface a note from two years ago that provides the perfect supporting evidence or a conflicting viewpoint.

### Automated "See Also" sections

Use the Explorer to quickly find notes that should be linked together. Instead of searching, simply look at the top 3 suggestions and add `[[links]]` to bridge your silos.

### Identifying duplicates

If a note shows a 99% similarity to another note, you might have accidentally created a duplicate or a very thin "stub" that should be merged.

## Controlling the Scope

You can adjust how the Explorer calculates similarity in Settings > Explorer.

-   Minimum similarity: Increase this if you only want to see very strong matches.
-   Number of results: Limit this to keep your sidebar clean.
