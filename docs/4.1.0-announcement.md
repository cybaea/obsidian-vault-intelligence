# Vault Intelligence 4.1.0: Precision, performance, and total control

**The "Black Box" era is over.**

If you are new here: **Vault Intelligence** involves more than just chatting with your notes. It is a graph-augmented engine that reads the *structure* of your vault—the links, the folders, the relationships—to understand what you mean, not just what you type.

In version 4.1.0, we have handed the keys to the engine over to you.

## 🎛️ Tune your agent's brain

Every vault is unique. Some are tightly linked "Digital Gardens"; others are loose collections of daily logs. A "one-size-fits-all" AI often fails to understand the nuance of *your* specific structure.

Now, you can fine-tune the **Graph-Augmented Relevance Score (GARS)**:

*   **Adjust similarity vs. centrality:** Do you want the AI to favour notes that *match* your keywords, or notes that are *important* hubs in your graph? You decide.
*   **Control the "spreading activation":** Decide how aggressively the agent follows links (siblings, parents, children) to find connected ideas.

## 🧹 Silence the noise

We have upgraded the Context Assembler with intelligent pruning.

Previously, search might return 20 "sort of" relevant notes, flooding the AI's context window with distractions. Now, the agent applies a dynamic **relevance floor**. It automatically discards weak matches, ensuring the AI only reads the 3–5 notes that *actually* matter.

*   **Result:** Sharper answers, less hallucination, and a "cleaner" feel to every interaction.

## ⚡ 95% faster metadata

We have rewritten the context fetching engine from the ground up.

*   **Zero-latency assembly:** By switching to `cachedRead` and batching metadata operations, we have reduced the time it takes to gather context headers by **95%**.
*   **Smoother UX:** The "Thinking..." phase is now noticeably snappier, especially in large vaults (10k+ notes).

### What else?

*   **Search expansion control:** A new slider to cap how many results trigger a graph expansion. Perfect for preventing "concept drift" on vague queries.
*   **Safety caps:** Absolute score floors prevent the agent from chasing weak connections down a rabbit hole.
