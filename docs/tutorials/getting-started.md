# Getting Started with Vault Intelligence

Transform your Obsidian vault into an active research partner in 5 minutes.

## 1. Install

1.  Open Obsidian **Settings** > **Community plugins**.
2.  Turn on **Restricted mode** (if not already on).
3.  Click **Browse** and search for `Vault Intelligence`.
4.  Click **Install** and then **Enable**.

## 2. Connect Intelligence

You need an API key to power the AI reasoning.

1.  Get a free API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  In Obsidian, go to **Settings** > **Vault Intelligence**.
3.  Paste your key into the **Google API key** field.

## 3. Your First Chat

Let's see the magic immediately.

1.  Click the **Robot Icon** in the left ribbon to open the Researcher sidebar.
2.  Click the **Agent** dropdown and select **Researcher**.
3.  Type this exact query (or pick a topic relevant to your notes):

    > "What is the most interesting connection between my notes on [Topic A] and [Topic B]?"

    *(Replace [Topic A]/[Topic B] with real topics from your vault, eg "Gardening" and "Recipes")*

### What just happened?

-   **It read your notes:** The agent found relevant files without you searching for keywords.
-   **It reasoned:** It didn't just copy text; it understood the relationship between the concepts.
-   **It answered:** You got a synthesized answer, cited with links to your source files.

## Next Steps
