# 5.1.0 — The Refinement & Clarity Update

Version 5.1.0 focuses on distilling the power of our new search architecture into a cleaner, more intuitive experience. After the major leap of version 5.0, this update prunes away legacy complexity and illuminates the path for power users to master the "Deep Recall" engine.

## Clutter-free control

We have streamlined the Advanced settings by removing obsolete GARS tuning and search expansion sliders. These legacy controls were designed for previous versions and are now handled automatically by the version 5 architecture, ensuring a focused configuration experience without redundant weights.

## Guided tuning for Deep Recall

Mastering the agent's focus is now easier with detailed documentation integrated directly into the settings. We've added comprehensive descriptions for the primary, supporting, and structural thresholds, explaining how each parameter influences how the Researcher "sees" your notes and builds its context.

## Visual precision

The Advanced settings tab has received a layout overhaul. With improved spacing and refined alignment, the interface now feels just as premium as the semantic intelligence under the hood, making fine-tuning a more pleasant experience for visual thinkers.

### Quality of life improvements

- **Scoring engine cleanup**: Removed unused parameters from the codebase to resolve scoring ambiguity and improve maintainability.
- **Improved hierarchy**: Section headers and descriptions in the Advanced tab are now more logically organized.
