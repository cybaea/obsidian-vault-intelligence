# Vault Intelligence 7.0.0

**The "Foundation" Update is here.**

Vault Intelligence 7.0 redefines what it means to be an "enterprise-grade" plugin. We've paused feature expansion to rebuild our core architecture for unbreakable security, massive scale, and total reliability.

**The Highlights:**
*   🔒 **Opt-In Security**: Complete control over network access. Localhost is blocked by default unless you say otherwise.
*   🧱 **Atomic Resilience**: A new storage engine that eliminates data drift and corruption, even during crashes.
*   🏗️ **Service Architecture**: A massive refactor that decoupled our systems, making the plugin faster and more stable than ever.
*   🛡️ **Hardened Defense**: New protections against prompt injection and path traversal.

**Install via BRAT:**
