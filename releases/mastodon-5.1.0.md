Vault Intelligence brings agentic AI and semantic intelligence to #Obsidian, helping you weave "hidden threads" between your notes.

After the giant leap of version 5.0, we found that power can sometimes bring clutter. Version 5.1.0 is about refinement, clarity, and mastering the engine.

We've pruned the Advanced settings.

The version 5 architecture is now smart enough to handle GARS weights and search expansion automatically. We've removed these obsolete sliders, giving you a cleaner, more focused interface to fine-tune what matters.

---

Complexity requires clarity.

We've added deep-dive documentation for context tuning parameters directly into the plugin. You can now see exactly how primary, supporting, and structural thresholds affect the Researcher's "vision", making it easier to master Deep Recall.

---

Visual precision matters.

We've overhauled the layout and spacing of the Advanced tab. It’s now easier to read and more pleasant to use, ensuring the configuration experience matches the premium feel of the rest of the plugin.

Gratitude to our early adopters who helped us identify these legacy edges after the 5.0 release! Your feedback is what makes Vault Intelligence smarter every day.
