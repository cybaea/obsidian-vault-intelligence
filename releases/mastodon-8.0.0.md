Vault Intelligence brings AI to #Obsidian, letting you research your vault and discover semantic connections.

With v8.0.0, we wanted to make exploring your notes more intuitive while addressing a common security frustration: plain text API keys. This is the Interactive & Secure Update.

We've replaced the static relationship list with the **Semantic Galaxy View**.

It's a high-performance, interactive graph that centres on your active note. It blends structural Wikilinks with semantic vector similarities, letting you visually discover how your ideas connect to each other.

---

The galaxy features **Visual RAG**. 

When the Researcher agent answers your queries and mentions files, those specific notes light up in the graph view. It provides instant spatial context for the AI's reasoning, showing you exactly where its thoughts are coming from.

---

Security matters. In version 8, your Google Gemini API key is now stored safely in your operating system's native keychain (like macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager). 

No more plain text keys sitting in your vault folder. Existing keys migrate automatically!

---

We've also polished the experience: the graph view dynamically adapts to Dark Mode, and model dropdowns now correctly update for new releases like Gemini 3.1 Pro when you refresh the list in settings.

A huge thank you to everyone who submitted bug reports and helped us refine the graph and secure storage implementation. Your feedback makes this plugin better for everyone.
