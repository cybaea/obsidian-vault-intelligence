# Vault Intelligence 5.2.0

Vault Intelligence is the high-performance AI research agent for your Obsidian vault, powered by Google Gemini.

This update brings a massive performance boost and hardened stability to your research workflow. Version 5.2.0 focuses on making the agent faster, more resilient, and more conceptually aware of your note hierarchy.

**Highlights**:

- **Blazing speed**: Agent response times reduced by 50% through optimised reasoning loops.
- **Ironclad resilience**: New atomic-like binary persistence prevents data corruption.
- **Conceptual intelligence**: The agent now identifies "Graph Neighbors" to find related notes that keywords might miss.
- **Multilingual mastery**: Full stopword support for 30+ languages, including Chinese, Hindi, and Japanese.
- **Resource efficiency**: Intelligent indexing debounces and file-change verification to save on API costs.
