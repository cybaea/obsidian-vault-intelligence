# Vault Intelligence 5.1.0

The "Refinement & Clarity" update is here! 

Vault Intelligence brings agentic semantic intelligence to your Obsidian vault, allowing you to research, explore, and organize your knowledge with the power of Google Gemini.

This update focuses on making the advanced power of our new search engine more accessible and clutter-free.

**The highlights**:

- **Simplified settings**: We've removed legacy "GARS" and expansion sliders that are now handled automatically, giving you a cleaner Advanced tab.
- **Deep-dive documentation**: New detailed guides for context tuning parameters are now baked directly into the settings UI.
- **UI polish**: Better layout and spacing in the Advanced tab for a more premium configuration experience.
- **Scoring precision**: Internal cleanup to ensure every similarity score is as accurate as possible.
