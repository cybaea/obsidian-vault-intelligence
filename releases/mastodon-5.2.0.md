# Vault Intelligence 5.2.0 Mastodon Thread

Vault Intelligence brings AI-powered research agents directly to #Obsidian. We've just released v5.2.0, focusing on the friction of latency and the need for rock-solid stability in large vaults.

Why does speed matter? Because deep research shouldn't feel like waiting on a slow server. In v5.2.0, we've overhauled our reasoning loops to reduce agent response times by up to 50%. It's the same intelligence, just twice as fast.

---

Stability is a feature. We've introduced atomic-like binary persistence for your index. No more corruption during sync conflicts. We also killed those pesky CORS errors for local embedding models. Your second brain is now more resilient than ever.

---

We're moving beyond keywords. Our new "Graph-Enhanced Intelligence" prioritises conceptual neighbors over simple text matches. The Researcher now understands your vault's hierarchy, finding the links you didn't even know you'd made.

---

We also added:
- Intelligent stopword support for 30+ languages.
- Preset chunk sizes for per-model optimization.
- Settings UI refinements for a more native feel.

The "Performance & Resilient Intelligence" update is a major step forward for local-first PKM.

Gratitude to our testers and users for the feedback that shaped this release. You can install Vault Intelligence via BRAT now.

Happy researching!
