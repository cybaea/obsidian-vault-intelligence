# Vault Intelligence 4.3.0

Vault Intelligence is an AI research agent for Obsidian that connects the dots in your vault, helping you find answers and discover hidden relationships using your own notes.

**This update brings full agentic capabilities, allowing the Researcher to create and edit notes on your behalf, along with native multilingual support.**

## Highlights

- Agentic Writing: The Researcher can now create notes, update files, and organise folders.
- Human-in-the-Loop: "Trust but Verify" modals with diff views ensure you approve every single change.
- Multilingual Support: Chat in French, German, Spanish, or any native language.
- Transient Models: Switch models on the fly for a single tough question without changing global settings.
