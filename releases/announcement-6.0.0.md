# Vault Intelligence 6.0.0

Vault Intelligence turns Obsidian into a proactive partner that researches, connects, and organises your ideas using Google Gemini.

This update focuses on **scale** and **mobile syncing**.

-   **Scale**: Support for 10,000+ note vaults with improved stability.
-   **Slim-Sync**: A ~90% smaller index footprint for bandwidth-friendly syncing to mobile devices.
-   **Resilient Memory**: The agent retains context across restarts and syncs.
-   **Multi-Model Support**: Switch between Local and Cloud embedding models without re-indexing.
-   **Storage Management**: A new dashboard to visualize and manage disk usage.

**NOTE**: This release is not database-compatible with previous versions. You will need to re-index your vault.
