# Vault Intelligence 8

Vault Intelligence is an AI agent currently powered by Google Gemini that lets you research your vault and discover related notes through semantic search.

This update brings a beautiful new interactive graph view for visualising your note relationships, and it hardens the security of your API keys.

* **Semantic Galaxy View**: Augmented the static relationship list with an interactive graph view that reacts to the Researcher agent (Visual RAG).
* **Discover Hidden Threads**: Seamlessly blend structural links with semantic vector similarities to uncover hidden connections in your knowledge base.
* **Secure API Storage**: Your Google Gemini API keys are now safely encrypted in your operating system's native keychain, keeping them out of plain text files.
* **Model Dropdown Fix**: Newly released Gemini 3.1 Pro models now correctly appear in the model selection dropdown when you refresh the list in the settings.
